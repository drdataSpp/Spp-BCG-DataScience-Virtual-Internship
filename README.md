## TASK 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Cleaning

### Background of the task 2
- The BCG project team thinks that building a churn model to understand whether price sensitivity is the largest driver of churn has potential. The client has sent over some data and the LDS wants you to perform some exploratory data analysis and data cleaning.
- The data that was sent over includes:
  - Historical customer data: Customer data such as usage, sign up date, forecasted usage etc
  - Historical pricing data: variable and fixed pricing data etc
  - Churn indicator: whether each customer has churned or not

These datasets are otherwise identical and have historical price data and customer data (including churn status for the customers in the training data).

### My task for Task 2
**Sub-Task 1:**
Clean the data – you might have to address missing values, duplicates, data type conversions, transformations, and multicolinearity, as well as outliers.

**Sub-Task 2:**
Perform some exploratory data analysis. Look into the data types, data statistics, and identify any missing data or null values, and how often they appear in the data. Visualize specific parameters as well as variable distributions.



## TASK 3 - Feature Engineering

### Background of the task 3
- The team now has a good understanding of the data and feels confident to use the data to further understand the business problem. The team now needs to brainstorm and build out features to uncover signals in the data that could inform the churn model.
- Feature engineering is one of the keys to unlocking predictive insight through mathematical modeling. Based on the data that is available and was cleaned, identify what you think could be drivers of churn for our client and build those features to later use in your model.

### My task for Task 3
**Sub-task 1:** Think through what key drivers of churn could be for our client.

**Sub-task 2:** Build the features in order to get ready to model.



## TASK 4 - Modeling & Evaluation

### Background of the task 4
- Recall that one of the hypotheses under consideration is that churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities and that it would be possible to predict customers likely to churn using a predictive model.
- The client also wants to try a discounting strategy, with the head of the SME division suggesting that offering customers at high propensity to churn a 20% discount might be effective.
- Build your models and test them while keeping in mind you would need data to prove/disprove the hypotheses, as well as to test the effect of a 20% discount on customers at high propensity to churn.

### My task for Task 4
**Sub-task 1:** Think through what key drivers of churn could be for our client.

**Sub-task 2:** Build the features in order to get ready to model.
